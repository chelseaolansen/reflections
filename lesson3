When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When collaborating with folks using different computers or if you yourself are working on a project from more than one computer.

Why night you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might have incomplete edits in the remote that you are not ready to pull into your local repository.

Describe the difference between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of the other.

A fork is a clone of a Github repository that is hosted on Github and links directly to its creator.
A clone is a copy of a repository that is hosted locally or remotely, but does not use forking format if it is a clone of a Github repository to a Github repository. A branch is a local path containing a series of commits.
