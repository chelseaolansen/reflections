When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When collaborating with folks using different computers or if you yourself are working on a project from more than one computer.

Why night you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might have incomplete edits in the remote that you are not ready to pull into your local repository.
