What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Whyyyy won't it commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and repository? What value do you think it offers?

Like, a preview?

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can add the components of that logical change to the staging area before making your commit. You can also compare what files are in your staging area to your committed repository before making your commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

If you're testing out an experimental version of your site that you want to have fully available to demonstrate without effecting your master site you could use branches. Or if you're testing a different language/mode of your site but aren't ready to merge the code onto your master.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

The diagrams show linearity. If you would have to backwards in a non-linear way, you would know that a branch is unreachable and it's easier to distinguish that with diagrams.
